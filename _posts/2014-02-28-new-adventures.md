<p>Today is my last day working at NAVTEQ\Nokia\<a title="HERE Maps" href="http://here.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>. I started at what was then <a title="NAVTEQ" href="http://navteq.com" target="_blank">NAVTEQ </a>in October 2010 after spending 4 years working in Kankakee County <a title="Kankakee County GIS" href="http://k3gis.com/" target="_blank">GIS</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last several years I&#8217;ve become more involved in the open government/open data/civic technology world (and of course the Chicago Public Schools community) and have worked on various open government and civic <a title="Affordable Care Act Outreach App" href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/projects/civic-innovation-in-chicago/affordable-care-act-outreach-app/" target="_blank">projects </a>in my &#8220;<a title="SchoolCuts at 4 am" href="http://schoolcuts.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/watch-schoolcuts-for-latest-closing-information/" target="_blank">free time.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>While I have loved working at NAVTEQ/HERE, it is clear from my Twitter <a title="@shua123" href="https://twitter.com/shua123" target="_blank">feed </a>that my passion is in the civic/government/non-profit/education world.  With a full time job (mostly) outside of that space it has been difficult to devote as much time as I would like to learning both the technical and personal/community sides of it and to contributing to as many projects as I would like. So now I am starting my own company <em>Kalov Strategies LLC</em> where I hope to be able to work more with community organizations and civic data/development.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very excited for my first project starting Monday. I will be working as a consultant with <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org" target="_blank">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a> on expanding Cook County Government&#8217;s <a href="https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/" target="_blank">Open Data Initiative</a> and open data releases through the Smart Chicago Collaborative &#8211; Cook County <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/on-our-partnership-with-cook-county-to-expand-open-data/" target="_blank">Partnership</a>.</p>
